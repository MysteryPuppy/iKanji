## iKanji
A Simple Terminal-Based Kanji Quizzer to Help Learn Kanjis from N5-N1.

The kanji CSV files were found on [this site](http://www.passjapanesetest.com/?s=N2+kanji&submit=Search) and at the moment it does not seem that the files for N1 and N2 are out yet.

**Installation:**
* Clone repository to machine
* Move into folder `cd ikanji`
* `python iKanji.py` to run quizzes. Made in Python 2.7 so might need some adjustments if only running Python 3.

**Note:** This program is for personal benefit so it does not have a lot of input sanitizing. That's out of personal preference and can easily be changed in the .py file.
